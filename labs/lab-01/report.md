Free Culture: In chapter 3 of Free Culture, RPI student Jesse Jordan is accused of copyright infringment after implementing his own version of a Microsoft file-sharing system for RPI students and faculty only. The problem, however, was that RPI students were using this file-sharing system to upload and share music. Even though Jesse did not intend for the distribution of music through his system, the RIAA claimed that he willingfully violated copyright laws due to his operation of the network. 

From this chapter, I learned about the dangers of Open-Source Software. Organizing and running this type of software requires a large amount of trust in the users. In Jesse's case, some of the RPI students utilizing the file-system were untrustworthy and this cost Jesse a lot of money.

Reflection: 
I read through multiple Open-Source projects on http://aosabook.org/en/index.html. One specific one that interested me was "A Pedometer in the Real World", because I have always wondered pedometers worked and how accurate the pedometers on our phone are. I also have an interest in physics, so this project is one that I might choose to evaluate. One problem is that I do not have much experience in Ruby. The main component of this pedometer is the parser. The parser uses the retrieved data to interpret whether or not the user took a step. All the data is then graphed and displayed on the web application.
