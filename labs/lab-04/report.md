3) License importance: 
Open source licenses hold the guidelines for those who wish to use the open source software. Since open source softwares are distributed widely across many softwares, it is extremely important to inform people on how to use it and what they can/cannot do with the software. 

4) Why not to use softwares without explicit licenses: 
Softwares that do not have licenses usually means that other users have no permission to access, modify or use the software, even though Github allows for users to fork the software. It is recommended that users ask the owners of the software for permission, or to find different softwares with proper licenses. 

5) Failure to follow the Open System Model: 
The Gopher team failed, because they did not release their software early in the development process. Instead they tried to do most of the work, because they had a clear 'right idea'. I agree that open source softwares should be released early, to allow for multiple different viewpoints and ideas to collaborate into one product. However, I believe that if the developers have a clear goal, and are able to handle the workload then it is unecessary to follow the open-source model exactly. 

6) 
The MIT License puts very limited restriction on reuse and modification. Microsoft's .NET uses the MIT License, because they have created an open-source community where all contributions are welcome as long as they follow the guidelines and make improvements to the software. They want users to use their software and improve on it.
